# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20)

**Core value:** Marco downloads one file, clicks through a 3-step wizard, and the tray icon turns green — forever after, follow-up texts and review requests go out automatically with zero ongoing attention.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Scaffold + Signing

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Scaffold + Signing) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-scaffold-signing P01 | 2 | 2 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: OV cert procurement must begin at kickoff — 2–10 business day lead time; use cloud HSM (DigiCert KeyLocker or SSL.com eSigner) for non-interactive CI signing
- Phase 3: Use raw jchv/go-webview2 (not Wails) — Bind() + Dispatch(Eval()) threading model; review example code before coding
- Phase 4: WebView2 bootstrapper strategy (Evergreen offline bundle ~120 MB vs Fixed Version Runtime) — decide during Phase 4 plan via POC size measurement
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: ifneq(strip) guard in Makefile prevents empty-string ldflags override when GSD_HMAC_SECRET is unset
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: CGO_ENABLED=0 for Phase 1 stubs; CGO introduced in Phase 3 for systray+webview2
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: No third-party deps in Phase 1 — only stdlib fmt and os in dispatcher

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SCAF-06 (OV cert provisioned into CI HSM) must be complete before Phase 4 ships; Phase 4 plan must gate on cert readiness
- Phase 3 research flag: jchv/go-webview2 Dispatch() threading for background-goroutine → UI updates is error-prone; review examples before coding
- Phase 5 research flag: /remote-config JSON schema + server-side storage not yet specified; design during Phase 5 plan
