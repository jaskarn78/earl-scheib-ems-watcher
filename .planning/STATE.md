# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-20)

**Core value:** Marco downloads one file, clicks through a 3-step wizard, and the tray icon turns green — forever after, follow-up texts and review requests go out automatically with zero ongoing attention.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Scaffold + Signing

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Scaffold + Signing) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: OV cert procurement must begin at kickoff — 2–10 business day lead time; use cloud HSM (DigiCert KeyLocker or SSL.com eSigner) for non-interactive CI signing
- Phase 3: Use raw jchv/go-webview2 (not Wails) — Bind() + Dispatch(Eval()) threading model; review example code before coding
- Phase 4: WebView2 bootstrapper strategy (Evergreen offline bundle ~120 MB vs Fixed Version Runtime) — decide during Phase 4 plan via POC size measurement
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: ifneq(strip) guard in Makefile prevents empty-string ldflags override when GSD_HMAC_SECRET is unset
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: CGO_ENABLED=0 for Phase 1 stubs; CGO introduced in Phase 3 for systray+webview2
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: No third-party deps in Phase 1 — only stdlib fmt and os in dispatcher
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: CGO_ENABLED=0 kept in Makefile not workflow; no mingw-w64 needed until Phase 3 (systray+webview2)
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: go-version-file: go.mod used in CI setup-go step to stay in sync as go.mod evolves
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: go-winres .syso output to cwd; Makefile mv step moves to cmd/earlscheib/ for Go auto-linking (Go only links .syso from the compiled package directory)
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: go-winres v0.3.3 schema uses #1 resource keys and 0409 LCID (not 0000/1) — plan template was incorrect; corrected from go-winres init output
- [Phase 01-scaffold-signing]: osslsigncode on ubuntu-latest (not signtool.exe on windows-latest) — Authenticode from Linux; CI signing conditional on SIGNING_CERT_B64 secret; RFC 3161 timestamp for post-expiry validity; dev-sign uses openssl ephemeral self-signed cert + /tmp for temp files

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SCAF-06 (OV cert provisioned into CI HSM) must be complete before Phase 4 ships; Phase 4 plan must gate on cert readiness
- Phase 3 research flag: jchv/go-webview2 Dispatch() threading for background-goroutine → UI updates is error-prone; review examples before coding
- Phase 5 research flag: /remote-config JSON schema + server-side storage not yet specified; design during Phase 5 plan
